# Macon County Website Redesign

This is a student project for my WEB210 course to redesign the Macon County, NC government website. The goal is to make information easier to find while keeping a clear, professional county government look.

> **Note:** This is **not** an official Macon County website.

## Pages

- **Home** – Hero carousel and links to main sections.
- **Government** – Cards for Commissioners, Meetings & Agendas, Boards, Notices, Budget, and Elections.
- **Departments** – Grid of major departments (Public Health, Social Services, Sheriff, Public Works, etc.).
- **Services** – Task-based cards (Pay Taxes, Permits, Records, Voting, Waste & Recycling, etc.) plus a “Need Help?” sidebar.

- **Visitors** – Image cards for parks, events, attractions, maps, and lodging.
- **About** – Mission, who the county serves, how government is organized, and transparency.
