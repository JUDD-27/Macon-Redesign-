# Macon County Website Redesign

This is a student project to redesign the Macon County, NC government website for my WEB210 course. The goal is to make information easier to find, improve the layout, and keep a clear, professional county government look.

> **Note:** This is **not** an official Macon County website. It is for educational purposes only.
